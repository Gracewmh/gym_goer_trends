## Tentative project title

FitCheck Insights: Unlocking Gym-Goer Trends

## Motivation for this project

- From the user’s perspective: This project aims to help fitness
  enthusiasts understand peak times, demographic trends, and popular
  locations, enabling them to optimize their workout schedules; for
  those new to fitness, it offers insights on when and how to start
  based on the habits of regular gym-goers.
- From the gym’s perspective: The project provides insights into user
  demographics and check-in patterns, helping gyms tailor services,
  staffing, and marketing efforts to meet client needs more effectively.

## Intended final products

- Interactive Visualizations: A set of interactive charts and maps
  showing check-in patterns, popular times, and user demographics across
  gym locations.
- Statistical Insights: Summary statistics and trend analyses
  highlighting key metrics like average attendance per location, busiest
  times, and demographic breakdowns.
- Personalized Recommendations: Data-driven suggestions for new
  gym-goers, such as optimal times to start and popular facilities based
  on user habits and trends.

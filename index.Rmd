# Webpage 

- This should give an overview of the **project scope, data, approaches, visualizations, and other results**, in a way that it is accessible to a broad audience. 
- Include **the full report as a page** in the website, so that readers can find a detailed explanation of your work.

# Screencast
- You will also create a **two-minute narrated screencast** illustrating your project (screencasts are videos of your computer screen with spoken audio explaining what is shown on the screen â€“ see the [RStudio webinar page](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/) for some examples). 
- You may use slides, demonstrations, or any other content that is relevant to your project. 
- **Publish your screencast on YouTube, Vimeo, or another online platform, and embed the screencast in your website.** The two-minute limit will be strictly enforced.

# Tips
- We suggest you **emphasize motivation, questions, and results over methods**
- after all, interested folks can view your complete project report on the same page.
